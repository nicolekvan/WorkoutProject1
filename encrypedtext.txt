The best revenge is to be unlike him who performed the injury.
It is not death that a man should fear, but he should fear never beginning to live.
If it is not right do not do it; if it is not true do not say it.
The first rule is to keep an untroubled spirit. The second is to look things in the face and know them for what they are.
Dwell on the beauty of life. Watch the stars, and see yourself running with them.
